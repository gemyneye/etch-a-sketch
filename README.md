## Notes from developing this
This has been an eye opener on objects and DOM manipulation. Understanding how 
things work on a 'cellular' level is challenging but rewarding in the fact that
I understand more. I certainly do not claim that I KNOW this. But it has taught 
me more jargon and reading MDN. This was an entry in to custom CSS properties and 
variables, in addition to computing them using JS. I learned more on event 
delegation and bubbling and how to utilize it. This is such a challenge but so 
awesome!
